Predicting Fruit and Vegetable Consumption from Demographic Factors: Do social environmental factors drive healthy decisions? 
Using the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) dataset, this study attempted to examine previous studies’ findings on relationships between one’s social environment and daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, in addition to finding new relationships. The literature review found many significant relationships between fruit and vegetable consumption, and socioeconomic status, region and urbanicity, demographic, and various lifestyle factors which were tested in the study as well. Linear modeling results show that the most positive relationship exists between higher fruit and vegetable consumption is high self-efficacy, including being a non-smoker. The most negative relationship found is being male. The findings are important for nutrition education and for more efficient healthcare spending.
